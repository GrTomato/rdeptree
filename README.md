### Project info
This is just a small pet project which helps me to learn Rust.
The main motivation is to replicate pipdeptree functionality in a program
which runs externally to the python env being used.


### Implemented functionality
For v0.0.1 rdeptree tool can print all packages installed for the current python env.
